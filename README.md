# My Projects

## [Project 3: Predicting Airbnb Prices](https://github.com/brendanoct/melb-airbnb-prices)

- By analysing data from Inside Airbnb, I attempted to predict Airbnb prices in Melbourne through the use of the supervised learning technique **K-Nearest Neighbours**, 
- **Hyperparameter Optimisation** was implemented to find the optimal value of **k** for our model
- My aim with this project was to see how well I could predict Airbnb prices in Melbourne, which could be useful for people looking to book holidays, seeking accommdation potentially through Airbnb

## [Project 2: Predicting House Sale Prices in NYC](https://github.com/brendanoct/nyc-house-prices)

- Utilising data fron NYC Department of Finance, I was attempting to use the data to predict and explain house prices in New York City
- Through **linear regression**, I was able to create a model using meaningful variables in an attempt to predict and explain the sale price of houses
- **K-Fold Cross Validation** was used to help determine how skilled my model was
- My aim with this project was to see mainly how well the size of a house explain or predict sale price across New York City

## [Project 1: Food Consumption and CO2 Emissions](https://github.com/brendanoct/food-cons-co2)

- Primarily through the use of **K-Means Clustering**, I explored how food consumption contributes to CO2 emissions
- Using the data, I was able to uncover groups of countries, as well as food categories that were responsible for a considerable amount of CO2 emissions
- I also undertook exploratory data analysis to see how non-animal product consumption relates to CO2 emissions relative to other countries
- My aim is to find these countries, and hope that this information can be useful for them to consider encouraging a shift in consumption tendencies of their citizens in aims of slowing down climate change
