- Primarily through the use of **K-Means clustering**, I explored how food consumption contributes to CO2 emissions
- Using the data, I was able to uncover groups of countries, as well as food categories that were responsible for a considerable amount of CO2 emissions
- I also undertook exploratory data analysis to see how non-animal product consumption relates to CO2 emissions relative to other countries
- My aim is to find these countries and hope that this information can be useful for these countries to consider changing consumption tendencies of their citizens to help slow down climate change
