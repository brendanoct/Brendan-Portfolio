- Utilising data fron NYC Department of Finance, I was attempting to use the data to predict and explain house prices in New York City
- Through **linear regression**, I was able to create a model using meaningful variables in an attempt to predict and explain the sale price of houses
- **Cross validation** was used to help determine how skilled my model was
- My aim with this project was to see mainly how well does the size of a house explain or predict sale price across New York City

- Primarily through the use of **K-Means clustering**, I explored how food consumption contributes to CO2 emissions
- Using the data, I was able to uncover groups of countries, as well as food categories that were responsible for a considerable amount of CO2 emissions
- I also undertook exploratory data analysis to see how non-animal product consumption relates to CO2 emissions relative to other countries
- My aim is to find these countries, and hope that this information can be useful for them to consider encouraging a shift in consumption tendencies of their citizens in aims of slowing down climate change
